# Train Scheduler
Scheduling application that uses Firebase and Mommentjs.

Train Scheduler was built to meet the requirements of the 7th homework
assignment for the [UCSD Coding Bootcamp](https://codingbootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/).

## Using the App
See a live example of the app [here](https://median-man.github.io/Train-Scheduler/).

The Train Scheduler connects to Firebase and loads the list of all the
current trains entered by users. The app will continue to update this
list in real-time as users add trains.

Trains may be added to the database using the provided form on the 
page.

The Momentjs library is used for calculating and displaying times.

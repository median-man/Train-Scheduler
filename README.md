# Train Scheduler
Scheduling application that uses Firebase and Mommentjs to continually display
data in real time without refreshing the page.

## Using the App
See a live demo of the app [here](https://median-man.github.io/Train-Scheduler/).

The Train Scheduler connects to Firebase and loads the list of all the
current trains in the database. Trains are added to and removed from the display
in real time as they are added/removed from the database.

Trains may be added to the database using the provided form on the 
page.

The Momentjs library is used for calculating and displaying times.

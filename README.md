# Train Scheduler
Scheduling application that uses Firebase and Mommentjs to continually display
data in real time without refreshing the page.

## Using the App
See a live demo of the app [here](https://median-man.github.io/Train-Scheduler/).

The Train Scheduler connects to Firebase and loads the list of all the
current trains entered by users. The app will continue to add trains to the list
whenever a new train gets added to the database by any user.

Trains may be added to the database using the provided form on the 
page.

The Momentjs library is used for calculating and displaying times.
